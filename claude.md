Design a AI visibility score system. I have the algorithm and calculation in the jupyter notebook ai_visibility_engine_full.ipynb. The goal is to display the final result report with is report_md in the notebook.
And it needs to take some input to generate that report, the input names are in the notebook:
    DEMO_BRAND,
    DEMO_INDUSTRY
    DEMO_DESCRIPTION
    API_KEY
create a simple and minimal front end that takes those input and generate the final report.
